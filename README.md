## Features
- Using a bottle on an enchanting table does not open the GUI
- Using attack, right click, shift left click, and shift right click abilities will create a client-side visual cooldown

## Known Issues
- Not all abilities have activate the cooldown. (I am not sure if all abilities are possible to detect client-side)
- Staves do not activate cooldowns (Staves work differently and will need extra attention)

## Future Plans
- REI support. I want REI support sooo bad.
